the value number is getting same number always coz its getting rendered always when we increase the number
our value is not persistent

Useref
ref is a refence who refs to existing value
main case is in dom manipulation

in react we use ref and there can be more than one ref
Dom manipulation is not directly possible through react hence we need to use ref always

parent
child1  propdrilling
child2

1. general hooks: usestate Useref useeffect
2. data: context api, usecontext 
3. optimization hook: useMemo

postman provider
createcontext : make bridges between the child and the parent and prevents prop drilling 
limitation: small scale application onlyy
                  small state onlyy
                  local state

globally we use redux for many thing 
flask and sst

Technique: optimization tech --> useMemo
