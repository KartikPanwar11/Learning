 
JIT
Compiled and interpreted lang (How it is this lang)
Single Threaded
Sync
Call stack
Web API's :- Messenger, when we req 3rd party info (kind of like storage)
C.B(call back) queue (in use of delay)
Micro task queue 
event loop
GEC (anonymous fn)

Shortest JS file

Var Let COnst

Hoisting :- before executing it will show undefined instead of any errors
            this only occurs in terms of Var
            In terms of let and const it will show ref errors

Let and const will end up in Temporal dead zone coz it will be hoisted but it will be in scrip
in the call stack which we called TDZ

Stack V/s Heap wrt to data type

CONDITIONALS
certain actions based on the conditions 
if else basically

do conditionals once again and solve the questions

Operations :- AND && | OR ||        NOT or Negation ! 

Loops :-






Scope :-
 Global Scope
 Function Scope  Var is restricted to a function only when its in function 
 Block Scope 

Lexical Environment

Spread Operator:
 concat the arr :- arr1.concat(arr2)
 instead of using concat i can use spread operator {let res= ...arr1,...arr2}
 // all this for the first level Compiled

Structured clone 
Json stringify 
above 2 method for more than one level arr and obj

Rest parameter:-
 just use ...parameter name 
 see arr and obj.JS file to see
 

Closures :-

Callback function
all function type
fn exp and declaration

Callbacks 17/07
currying 
ioc 
high order function
pyramid of hell

dry principle //do not repeat ur function

map // bts it runs a loop which we have done in HOF
array.prototype
