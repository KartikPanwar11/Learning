Shortest JS file

Var Let COnst

Hoisting :- before executing it will show undefined instead of any errors
            this only occurs in terms of Var
            In terms of let and const it will show ref errors

Let and const will end up in Temporal dead zone coz it will be hoisted but it will be in scrip
in the call stack which we called TDZ

Stack V/s Heap wrt to data type
